##Rules
At the start of the game all levers or tiles are "open" (cleared, up), showing the numerals 1 to 9.
During the game, each player plays in turn. A player begins his or her turn by throwing or rolling the die or dice into the box. If 1 is the only tile still open, the player may roll only one die. Otherwise, the player must roll both dice.
After throwing, the player adds up the dots (pips) on the dice and then "shuts" (closes, covers) one of any combination of open numbers that equals the total number of dots showing on the dice.
